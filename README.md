# Predictive-Modeling-and-Clustering-for-Bank-Marketing-Campaigns

**Introduction:**
  This project builds predictive models and performs clustering on the "bank-additional-full" dataset, containing 41,188 records from a Portuguese bank's telemarketing campaign. It aims to refine strategies for long-term deposit subscriptions, using machine learning to evaluate success with metrics like ROC and AUC, driving actionable insights.
**Data Exploration**
The dataset, containing numeric and categorical variables, was analyzed for structure and missing values. Histograms and bar plots visualized distributions, while bivariate plots examined relationships with the target variable. Below are codes from the analysis of the "bank-additional-full" dataset (bank_df), focused on banking activities.
